🔧 HOW TO FIX RAILWAY - ADD SUPABASE CREDENTIALS

The problem: Railway doesn't have Supabase credentials, so it can't connect to Supabase Storage.
The solution: Add these environment variables to Railway.

STEP-BY-STEP:

1. Go to https://railway.app/

2. Click on your "stolen" project

3. Click on the backend service

4. Click "Variables" tab

5. Click "New Variable" button

6. Add variable #1:
   Name:  SUPABASE_URL
   Value: https://dntnjlodfcojzgovikic.supabase.co

7. Click "New Variable" button again

8. Add variable #2:
   Name:  SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
   Value: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Inhlem12c2xnYWNsaWRsa3Bra3VjIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDc1MTIyOCwiZXhwIjoyMDc2MzI3MjI4fQ.Ng9PfSDxB8f2Hdy6tHrdGXgK9MdrVPSxjKnD8fo6lbQ

9. Railway will automatically redeploy

10. Wait 2 minutes for deployment

11. Your iOS app should now load images!

That's it!
