🔧 HOW TO FIX RAILWAY TO USE SUPABASE DATABASE

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard:
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dntnjlodfcojzgovikic/settings/database

2. Copy the "Connection string" (looks like):
   postgresql://postgres.[PROJECT]:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres

3. Go to Railway Dashboard:
   https://railway.app/

4. Click on your backend service

5. Click "Variables" tab

6. Find DATABASE_URL

7. Replace the current value with the Supabase connection string you copied in step 2

8. Click "Deploy" or restart the service

That's it! Your Railway backend will now use the Supabase database which already has the correct product images.

✅ The images are already uploaded to Supabase Storage
✅ The database already has the correct URLs
You just need to connect Railway to the right database!
